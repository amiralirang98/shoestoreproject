# shoestoreproject
This website is to be created for a shoe seller where we have to provide a method to manage database and add and remove products, manage stock etc. without worrying about databases and there integration.
The seller is a non technical person so the website and its working both from user as well as admin side should be developed with and understandable user interface.
The website will contain a display page from where a user can book his product and a payment gateway through which he can pay. Once a order is placed notify seller about that and once the order is shipped seller can mark it as done. All necessary changes must reflect in database also.
